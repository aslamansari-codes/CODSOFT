# Iris Flower Classification

## About the Project
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CodSoft**.  
The objective of this project is to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their physical measurements.

This project helped me understand multi-class classification and the complete machine learning workflow.

## Dataset Information
- Dataset: Iris Dataset
- Total Samples: 150
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target Variable:
  - Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

The dataset is clean and does not contain any missing values.

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Checked the dataset for missing values (none found).
- Separated input features and target variable.
- Encoded the target labels into numerical format for model training.

No additional cleaning was required as the dataset was already well-structured.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following visualizations were created to understand the data:
- Distribution of Iris species
- Petal Length vs Petal Width scatter plot
- Sepal Length vs Sepal Width scatter plot

EDA showed that petal measurements are more effective in distinguishing between Iris species.

## Model Used
- Algorithm: **Logistic Regression**
- Type: Multi-class Classification
- Data Split:
  - 80% Training Data
  - 20% Testing Data

Logistic Regression was chosen for its simplicity and good performance on well-separated datasets.

---

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy Achieved: 100%**
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix

The model correctly classified all test samples.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.  
Logistic Regression performed exceptionally well due to clear separability between flower species.

The project strengthened my understanding of classification models, data visualization, and evaluation techniques.
